# Settings for Visual Studio Mac

MacOS is the place where MonoDevelop managed to survive. Not just survive, it also became supportable. And now it called Visual Studio for Mac.
All the instructions tested with **Visual Studio Community 2019 for Mac** (Version 8.5.3, build 16)

Generally config files may be found in next folders:
- `~/Library/VisualStudio/8.0/`
- `~/Library/Preferences/VisualStudio/8.0/`

## Key Bindings
Copy [KeyBindings/Custom.mac-kb.xml](./VisualStudioMac/KeyBindings/Custom.mac-kb.xml) to `~/Library/VisualStudio/8.0/KeyBindings/`
